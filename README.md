# calculator
Simple Calculator created with HTML and CSS only, used Flexbox to manipulate the space between buttons of the calculator and simple functions of JavaScript (toString(), splice(), eval()) connected form in the HTML, i assumed that i didnt need a whole seperate .js file to manipulate the DOM in the HTML so i did all inside the HTML in the form tag.
